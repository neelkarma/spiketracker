# todo list

in order of priority:

- dashboard redesign
- link dashboard to backend
- implement heatmaps
- implement page-specific help
- add help content (screenshots and all)
- make pages print-friendly
- make login screen responsive
- clean up the backend code (it is pretty nasty rn - maybe extract all the db stuff into its own module)
- clean up the frontend code (there are plenty of things that can be extracted into their own components/functions)
- add code comments to everything
- add more details in readme (file structure, how to run, common commands, etc.)
- iron out any bugs
- consult with team
- figure out hosting
