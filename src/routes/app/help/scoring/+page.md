# Scoring Tutorial

One of the main functions of SpikeTracker is to be an easy and efficient way to
score matches in real time. This tutorial will outline the steps for both
players and admins to score a match.

## Step 1: Open the match for scoring (Admin)

Assuming a match is already created, the admin must first mark the match as open
for scoring before players are able to score the match.

While logged into the admin account:

1. Click **Matches** in the navigation bar.
2. Click the edit icon on the desired match.
3. Check the "Players can see this match" and "Players can score this match"
   checkboxes.
4. Click "Apply".

## Step 2: Enter the scoring interface

Once step 1 is complete, players can now score the match.

While logged into either a player or an admin account:

1. Click **Matches** in the navigation bar.
2. Click **Enter Scoring** on the match to be scored. If it is greyed out, then
   Step 1 was not completed correctly.

At this point, you will be greeted with the scoring interface. Confirm that you
are indeed scoring the intended match by checking the team and opponent names
displayed.

## Step 3: Scoring the match

As players take actions on the field, such as attacks, blocks, sets, serves,
etc., they must be recorded in the scoring interface.

To record a court action:

1. Click the name of the person who did the action.
2. On the field diagram that appears, click the contact and landing points of
   the action.
3. Select the type of action (set, attack, block, etc.) of the action.
4. Select the rating of the action (3 being the best). This will also save the
   action.

After all actions are recorded, and the match has ended, click the "Submit"
button.

## Step 4: Review and Publication (Admin)

After the player has scored and submitted the match, the admin can go back to
the edit page of the match, uncheck "Players can score this match", input the
final scores of the match, and click "Apply".

This will allow players to view the statistics for the match. The statistics
will also be updated for the team and any players who participated in the match.
