# Court Heatmaps

Court heatmaps are prevalent throughout SpikeTracker. They allow you to quickly
inspect the impact and landing points of all court actions for any match, team
or player.

It will display different data depending on context - for example, on the player
dashboard, the court heatmap will only display the player's court actions.

## Controls

There are three main controls for the court heatmap, all located on the top:

- **Rating** - This allows you to only show actions of a specific rating (3
  being the best), or show all actions regardless of rating.
- **Action Type** - This allows you to display actions of a specific type (e.g.
  Sets, Attacks, Blocks, etc.)
- **Shot Point** - This allows you to toggle between showing where the shot was
  contacted and where the shot landed.

## Interpretation

The court heatmap is presented as a top-down view of the volleyball court. The
opponent's side of the court is on the top of the heatmap. Court actions will
appear on the heatmap as black dots, with contours surrounding each point to
convey the frequency of player actions at specific coordinates.
