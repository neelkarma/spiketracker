# Printing

Almost every page in SpikeTracker has printing capabilities. When printing, all
interactive elements will automatically be removed, only leaving raw data and
statistics on the final print layout.

To print the current page, click the **Print current page** button at the bottom
of the page:

![Print current page button](/help/print-button.png)

If this button is not present, it means that the page you are on does not
support printing.

Alternatively, you can print using the inbuilt controls of your browser:

## On Desktop

To print the current page on desktop platforms, either:

- Use the <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
- Click on the menu icon of your browser, and then "Print".

## On Mobile

To print the current page on mobile platforms, click on the menu icon of your
browser, and then "Print".
