# Printing

Almost every page in SpikeTracker has printing capabilities. When printing, all
interactive elements will automatically be removed, only leaving raw data and
statistics on the final print layout.

## On Desktop

To print the current page on desktop platforms, either:

- Use the <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
- Click on the menu icon of your browser, and then "Print".

## On Mobile

To print the current page on mobile platforms, click on the menu icon of your
browser, and then "Print".
