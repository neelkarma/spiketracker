# Search and Sort

There is a searchbar in the Matches, Teams, and Players pages.
Type in your query and SpikeTracker will display all relevant items.

On the right of the searchbar is a button to open up filter options. This is where you can sort items based on alphabetical order, creation date, etc.
On the filter options, you can sort players by first name, last name, and graduation year. There is also a checkbox to reverse the order.
